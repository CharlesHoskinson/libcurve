# CLAB - experimental C classes

CLAB (libclab) is an experimental space that provides an incubator for CZMQ, the high-level C binding for Ã˜MQ applications.  While CZMQ is generally "stable", CLAB is always "experimental". CLAB classes that prove useful may be moved into CZMQ. CLAB classes that prove useless may be deleted. The CLAB API is never considered stable and may change without notice.

## Building and Installing

CLAB uses autotools for packaging. To build from git (all example commands are for Linux):

    git clone git://github.com/imatix/clab.git
    cd clab
    sh autogen.sh
    ./configure
    make all
    sudo make install
    sudo ldconfig

You will need the libtool and autotools packages. On FreeBSD, you may need to specify the default directories for configure:

    ./configure --with-libzmq=/usr/local

After building, you can run the CLAB selftests:

    make check
